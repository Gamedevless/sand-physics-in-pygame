# sand-physics-in-pygame
basic sand physics made in pygame

we create a list that contains all cells
when we click the mouse button we add a new cell to the list
each cell contains two values: x, y
each cell follow the same rules:
if the cell bellow it is empty move down
else if the cell on the right side of the cell bellow it is empty move down and then move right
else if the cell on the left side of the cell bellow it is empty move down and then move left

thats all what you need to now
